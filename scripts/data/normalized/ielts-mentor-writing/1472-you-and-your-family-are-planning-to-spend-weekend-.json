            "Dear Sir or Madam,\nI am writing to you to make the necessary arrangements for our stay at your hotel on 22nd and 23rd November. I will travel with my parents, wife and 7 years old son. I am hoping that you would be able to provide us with suitable accommodation and assist us to enjoy our trip.\nWe will arrive on 22nd November and check out from your hotel on 24th November before 12.00 pm. We are expecting two double size bedrooms with attached bathrooms, hot water and air cooler facilities. We would prefer rooms with a sea view and room service. I would really appreciate it if the rooms are on the same floor.\nI am also interested to know about recreational activities in the vicinity. Despite my parent’s age, they are very lively and would love to go to the theatre, beach and amusement parks, if available. I would also like to know about the market, where we can buy traditional items and souvenirs.\nPlease notify me of the cost that will incur on our trip at your earliest with the facilities you can offer. I am expecting a comprehensive reply from your side about the details of the activities and other information I requested.\nI look forward to hearing from you soon.\nYours faithfully,\nFahad Sultan\n[",
