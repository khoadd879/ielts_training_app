My major is \"Hotel and Tourism Management\" and I am looking for a part-time job in a hotel to gain some hands-on knowledge. Since I live in the same town, I have had the opportunity to see your hotel. I also know how your hotel business contributes to the local economy of our town.\nAnyway, I think that I would be able to offer a great service to your hotel since I have already worked at a hotel in the past as a part-time Front Desk Officer. Besides, I have also worked as a part-time waiter at one of the busiest restaurants in our town. Moreover, I am energetic, and I have good communication skills.\nFinally, I am willing to start as soon as you ask me, only if you choose to hire me and tell me exactly what my roles and responsibilities should be at your hotel.\nHope to hear from you soon.\nYours faithfully,\nChuck Moore\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\nRating 3.80 (10 Votes)\nIELTS Letter Writing\nGT Writing Task 1\nFormal Letter\nPrev\nNext\nName\nPreview\nSend\nReset\nCancel\nRSS\nSam\n8 years 5 months\nDear Sir/Madam,I am writing this letter in reference to your advertisement on ABC for hiring a weekend support staff in your hotel.
