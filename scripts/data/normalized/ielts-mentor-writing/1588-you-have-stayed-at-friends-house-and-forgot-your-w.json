            "Dear Dylan,\nHope you are fine and enjoying the spring. I would like to thank you for a great weekend at your house. It was so exciting that I will always be grateful to you for being such a great host. I hope you can visit us soon with your wife and son and I look forward to spending some quality time together.\nWhen I got back home, I noticed that I forgot my watch at your house. My best guess is that I have left it in the bathroom. Before leaving your house I took a shower and presumably that is the time when I left it there. It is a Seiko (Japan) Automatic diver's analogue watch for men that comes with a circular dial. The strap and dial of the watch are black while the lug, buckle and bezel are silver. I am sure you will recognise it as soon as you see it.\nI hope it would not be a trouble for you to send it to me. I really like this wristwatch and it was a gift from Maria. She would be disappointed if I lose it. Please send it via a courier service to my home address and I will bear the courier cost.\nWish to see you all soon.\nWarm wishes,\nPeter\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\nRating 4.58 (6 Votes)\nIELTS Letter Writing\nInformal Letter\nPersonal Letter\nPrev\nNext\nName\nPreview\nSend\nReset\nCancel\nRSS\n×\nReport\nReport\nClose"
