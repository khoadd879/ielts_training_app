            "Dear Sir or Madam,\nI am a fan of your informative editorial and articles which I try to read as often as I can. I also like to share and exchange local information with my fellow residents of this town on different forums, such as your newspaper. And, as a part of this information sharing effort, I would like to talk about a restaurant, where I visited recently with my family members, which I think is worth visiting.\nWe tried several meals at that restaurant, and I must say that they were of top quality because they all seemed to be made with fresh ingredients. I especially liked their “mushroom fettuccine”, made with some perfectly grinded hot pepper flakes and evenly cut mushrooms. The French fries served there were also very delicious and chewy. Besides, I also liked the nice sitting arrangement there in front of their spacious porch, which was nicely decorated with different kinds of flower plants. As for the customer service there, I think that the staff at the restaurant knew perfectly well how to make their customer happy.\nSo, based on these findings, I would certainly recommend this restaurant to anybody and hope that you would publish an article reviewing and recommending this restaurant to your readers.\nYours faithfully,\nGeorge Malone",
            "Dear Sir or Madam,\nI am a regular reader of your daily newspaper “Times of India.” I am writing this letter to inform you about an authentic restaurant called “Step and Eat” which I have visited recently with my family. I reckon this is a worth visiting place for others and hoping that you would write a review on this eatery to let others know about this fabulous place.\nLocated on Smith Street near the National Park, it is a multi-cuisine restaurant. I went there with my family last Sunday. As we are fond of Italian food, my husband ordered an Italian meal. The meal comprised of a delicious soup, a signature dish of the hotel known as mixed vegetable spaghetti and at the end we had a mouth savouring dessert called Green Marshmallows which had a perfect creamy texture. It was one of the memorable dinners I have ever had with my family.\nThe restaurant is worth visiting for everyone in the town because it offers a wide range of varieties in food to satisfy the human palate. Moreover, it maintains proper cleanliness and hygiene. The staff members are so polite, co-operative and professional - which gives a diligent feeling to the customers.\nHence, I request you to write an article or review on this restaurant so that more people could come to know and visit it.\nI look forward to hearing from you.\nYours faithfully,\nVishwa Vinutna\n["
