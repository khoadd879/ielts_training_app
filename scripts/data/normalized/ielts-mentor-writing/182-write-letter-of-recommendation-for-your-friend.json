            "Dear Sir or Madam,\nI have been notified by one of my close friends that your organisation is looking for a few bilingual assistant tutors to work with foreign children. I am writing to you to recommend one of my best friends, Anna Pattison, whom I consider a deserving candidate for the post.\nI know Anna for more than 14 years. She used to be my classmate at the Cherry Blossom International School and then at Saint John College. She used to be an enthusiastic organiser and participant in extracurricular activities. For her outstanding leadership skills and cheerful personality, she was nominated class captain for most of her academic years in school. Her excellent skills in both English and Spanish make her ideal for the post that involved working closely with children.\nShe completed her graduation from Arts major and received a distinctive medal for her exceptional academic performance. Upon her graduation, she worked as a teacher in an international school in London, where she has been teaching bilingual lessons for five years. What’s more, she loves being around children and easily wins their hearts.\nTherefore, I do not hesitate to recommend her as an ideal candidate for the post you advertised. I am sure she would be an excellent candidate for the post.\nYours faithfully,\nEnya Brennan\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\nRating 4.75 (10 Votes)\nIELTS Letter Writing\nGT Writing Task 1\nFormal Letter\nPrev\nNext\nName\nPreview\nSend\nReset\nCancel\nRSS\n×\nReport\nReport\nClose"
