            "Dear Sir or Madam,\nMy name is John Timothy, and I rented a car from your company on 24th June. Unfortunately, the car has a major problem and need your attention to fix the issue.\nAs per the rental agreement, I would keep the car for three weeks, and if there are any problems with the car, your company would take care of them as quickly as possible. But, it looks like your rental company is not following through with the agreement terms. To explain the situation, the AC of my car stopped working within a couple of days of renting it. I immediately called your company to fix it, but after 5 days, it still has not got fixed.\nPlease understand that I travel quite a lot in this scorching heat, and I do not see a chance that I can do it for another day without the AC. Therefore, based on the problem, I would highly appreciate it if you fix the car today. But, if that is not an option, please give me another car without any problem.\nI hope to hear from you soon.\nYours faithfully,\nJohn Timothy\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\nRating 4.53 (15 Votes)\nIELTS Letter Writing\nFormal Letter\nComplaints-letter\nPrev\nNext\nName\nPreview\nSend\nReset\nCancel\nRSS\nIELTS Mentor\n8 years 6 months\nDear Sandy, we will have more rigid moderation on those contents.
