I was so excited to have been invited to your birthday and I even had plans for the occasion. But the last moment of emergency compelled me to change my plan. I'm sorry that I even had not informed you.\nI hope you had a grand party on your birthday. I'm so happy to see the fabulous photos on Facebook. I wish I could've been there too. But just before your birthday, I got a call that from my hometown and was terribly shocked by the news that my grandfather had a heart attack. I flew to my hometown without any delay and had been there for a couple of days. Fortunately, my grandfather has recovered and is out of danger now.\nI would be terribly busy the whole week in my office due to a missed deadline. Hopefully, I will be at my usual pace within a few days. I would like to meet you at your home and stay at the weekends. I won't forget your birthday present.\nWarm wishes,\nNickol",

            "Dear Benjamin,\nHope you are enjoying your life and your newly-found career. But, before anything else, please allow me to apologize to you first since I couldn’t attend your birthday. Even more frustrating for me is the fact that I couldn’t write to you early enough to tell you why I couldn’t attend your birthday.\nAnyway, the reason, for which, I couldn’t attend your birthday is that I fell sick with nausea and stomach pain (probably because of some kind of food poisoning) just before the night of your birthday. Then, as soon as I felt little better two days later, I had to travel to another city because one of my foreign bosses arrived in our country, and I needed to accompany him for the next couple of days. So, you can guess how hectic the last few days have really been for me, so much so that I even forgot to write to you earlier and say that I am sorry.\nAnyway, let bygones be bygones, and please allow me to say \"Happy Birthday\" once again. I would also like to take you to the most upscale restaurant in the town and buy you the most expensive and best dish that you have eaten.\nSee you soon.\nWarm wishes,\nBevan\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\nRating 4.69 (8 Votes)\nIELTS Letter Writing\nGT Writing Task 1\nInformal Letter\nPersonal Letter\nPrev\nNext\nName\nPreview\nSend\nReset\nCancel\nRSS\n×\nReport\nReport\nClose"
