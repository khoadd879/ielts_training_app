I am writing to get the details about the scholarship program that your university offers as I am really interested to complete my Master's degree from your university.\nI would like to pursue my Master's degree at Loughborough University and I am looking forward to getting a scholarship in the faculty of Engineering System and Design. As I want to build a career in the Engineering sector, I would like to complete my Master's degree in the same faculty that I did for my graduation.\nI am convinced that doing the post-graduation at Loughborough University would be an excellent decision for me as the university offers the opportunity to study a subject at an advanced level, develop personal and professional skills, and it is one of the best universities in the UK. The 440-acre single-site campus offers great facilities for students, staff and gives every student the opportunity they need to achieve their full potential. I would be very proud to be a part of this glorious university.\nI want to continue my Master's course in Engineering Systems and would be able to do so only if I am granted a scholarship as I come from a middle-class family. My Engineering Systems and Design graduation course had 138 credits in total and I achieve a CGPA of 3.89 out of 4.0. I have part-time job experience in the Engineering design field and I believe I can prove my competency for the scholarship provided that I get an opportunity.\nI look forward to your reply and would really appreciate your guidance regarding this.\nYours faithfully,\nLee Gordon",

            "Dear Sir or Madam,\nI am writing this letter to inquire about a scholarship program that your university offers to foreign students. I have already finished my bachelor’s degree in Economics, and now I want to pursue a master’s degree in the same subject.\nI have already learned quite a lot about your university by reading everything on its website. Needless to say, I like everything about your university which includes very modern and well-equipped classrooms, a universal curriculum, affordable hostel accommodation, and highly qualified and experienced professors and lecturers. However, what I find the most impressive about your university is its very high campus placement rate which is about 75 per cent.\nI know it is not easy to get a scholarship at your university, but I think that my good grades in bachelor degree (GPA 3.90 out of 4) and a high score in TOEFL (623 out of 677) would make me eligible to receive a scholarship in my subject.\nI look forward to hearing your response on my eligibility to receive a scholarship at your university.\nYours faithfully,\nKishor Gupta\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\nRating 4.58 (12 Votes)\nIELTS Letter Writing\nGT Writing Task 1\nFormal Letter\nInquiry Letter\nPrev\nNext\nName\nPreview\nSend\nReset\nCancel\nRSS\nNeha\n7 years 7 months\nDear Sir/ Madam,I am writing this letter to express my interest in pursuing Catering Diploma course from the Sydney University.
