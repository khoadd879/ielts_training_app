I am writing to express my immeasurable admiration for your altruistic and brave action.\nI am Simon Annand, a math teacher at the Cherry Blossom high school, and I live with my family at 24 Abbey Rise Street, London. On my way to the school at around 8.30 am last Monday, my motorbike crashed with a private car near Aberdeen Drive and I lost control. I was severely injured and could not move or pick up my bike. If you had not decided to help me, the situation could have been worse.\nI am so grateful to you for your kind help and generous words. You even took the burden to take me to a nearby hospital and that was so noble of you. I cannot express enough how thankful I am to you. When my parents and wife heard about how courageously you assisted me, they prayed for you even though they have never met you before.\nI regret that I could not thank you enough. Please accept my invitation to visit our home at your convenience and allow my family to thank you properly. I have recovered quickly and the thanks go to you. Please visit us with your family and let our brief encounter becomes an opportunity to know you more.\nYours truly,\nSimon",

            "Dear Mr Ralph,\nHope you are doing well by the grace of the Almighty. My name is Roger Freddie, who you took care of after an accident last week. And, I am writing this letter to express how grateful I am to you because of saving my life.\nI am greatly indebted to you because if you were not brave and decisive enough to immediately transport me to the nearest hospital after that big truck had hit my motorbike from behind on that fatal day, I don’t think that I would be alive today to say “thank you” to you. I would also like to say that it is because of Samaritans like you, this world still is a good place to live and still has some hope and goodness left in it.\nI know that I would never be able to repay you back for the most wonderful charitable deed you did for me, but it would make me feel a little better if you would be kind enough to at least visit my home sometime in the next week and have dinner with my family. Please also bring your family with you, if you like.\nYours sincerely,\nRoger Freddie\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\nRating 4.59 (11 Votes)\nIELTS Letter Writing\nGT Writing Task 1\nSemi-formal Letter\nPrev\nNext\nName\nPreview\nSend\nReset\nCancel\nRSS\nEtisha\n4 years 5 months\nDear Mr Thomas,\nI hope you and your family are doing well. My name is Etisha, and last Friday while returning from my office I had an accident at Queens Road near the square. I am writing this to thank you for your efforts to take me to the hospital after my accident and for saving my life.\nI was in a hurry as it was my daughter's birthday and was already very late to leave the office. Suddenly my car was dashed by from the backside and I lose control over the steering. I was not at all conscious at that time and when I inquired from the hospital I got your details. I am so overwhelmed with your gesture and could not stop myself to write you this note.\nMy mother wanted to meet you and thank you personally and therefore, we would like to invite you for the dinner at our home and express our gratitude.\nLooking forward to hearing from you.\nYours sincerely,\nEtisha Jain\nReply\nQuote\nKevin\n5 years\nDear Bob, I am thankful to you during this Covid Pandemic.\nReply\nQuote\nMohammed\n6 years 1 month\nDear Mr Mahmud,\nMy name is Mohammed Ahmed, and I am originally from Yemen. I have been working in Cambodia for the last two years as an accountant. I am writing to express my gratitude to you for your commendable and kind help and support after I had been involved in an accident on Morfe street on Monday 14th April.\nI really appreciate your support when you pulled me from the street, gave me initial first aid and then took me to the hospital. Actually, I could not imagine that a stranger will help me in such a helpless and desperate situation. You showed fantastic ethics and a noble heart when you helped me that day.\nI can not thank you enough for this support without which I do not know what could have happened! So, I want to take this opportunity to invite you and all your family members to have lunch at my home which is located near Anvilla Company Avenue street block, B house, number 878, street no. 76.\nI can not wait to meet you and thank you in person.\nYours sincerely,\nMohammed Ahmed\nReply\nQuote\nPhav0904\n7 years 4 months\nDear Ms Stone,\nI am Pamela Scott whom you helped last Monday in an event of a car accident on Circunvalation Avenue. I appreciate your brave action to help me get out of the car and then call the ambulance. You even filled in your personal details in the guarantee paper when the ambulance and medical assistants arrived. I am writing to express my gratitude and invite you to visit my family.\nIt is not common these days to find people who help a stranger. I want to show my gratefulness for your novel actions. I learned a lot from this critical situation, and I will try to be like you in the future to help anyone in need. After the unfortunate car accident, you were the only person who came to my rescue.\nI would be grateful if you accept my invitation to visit me, with your family, next Friday for a family dinner. I will be honoured to have you and your family at my home.\nI am eagerly waiting for your response and once again thank you.\nBest Regards,\nPamela Scott\nReply\nQuote\nds\n7 years 8 months\nThank you.\nReply\nQuote\nAbd Alwhab Mansur\n7 years 11 months\nDear Ahmed,\nI am Abdalwhab whom you helped last month after a car accident in Zubairi Street. I want to thank you for your kind help and care for me until the ambulance arrived. I am writing to show my gratitude and invite you to visit my family.\nIt is not common these days to find a novel man who extends his helping hands in order to help a stranger. I want to show my gratefulness and appreciation for your kindness. And I will never forget your kind actions in that critical situation. After the unexpected car accident, you were the only person who selflessly came to my rescue. I will be always in your debt.\nKindly accepts my invitation to visit me with your family next Monday for dinner. It will be my honour to meet you and your family. My family also knows how remarkably you supported me at a critical time and they are also looking forward to meeting you.\nWaiting for your kind response.\nYours sincerely,\nAbdalwhab Mansur\nReply\nQuote\n×\nReport\nReport\nClose"
