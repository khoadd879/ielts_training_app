            "Dear Mr Martin,\nI am writing this letter to ask for your kind permission in order to make a presentation in our office for the purpose of sharing some important information. It is worth mentioning that I learned about the information by attending a conference a few days ago that talked about \"strategies to meet project deadlines\" in a very eloquent and elaborated manner.\nAnyway, the conference had continued for almost three hours since a good number of experts and experienced professionals attended it and exchanged their views and opinions on this very important issue. But, as far as I am concerned, in my presentation, I would mostly cover the subject of planning effectively to meet the deadlines and how important it is for us to finish our projects in time. In other words, my presentation would mostly deal with the issues we can address to complete our projects in time.\nBy the way, I would like to conduct this presentation in our meeting room, and anybody can attend this if they feel interested.\nHope you will permit me to conduct the presentation which deals with an important issue.\nYours sincerely,\nRudy Robinson\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\nRating 4.55 (11 Votes)\nIELTS Letter Writing\nSemi-formal Letter\nPrev\nNext\nName\nPreview\nSend\nReset\nCancel\nRSS\nAsma Akter\n7 years 11 months\nIt's really helpful for us.\nReply\nQuote\n×\nReport\nReport\nClose"
