I was excited when it arrived but very disappointed to find that the product was poorly made and unusable. I am hoping that you will replace it soon.\nIn relation to the specifics of the order, I purchased this leather wallet through your website called Fashion Era on July 27th using my PayPal account. The order number is W34405 and I am attaching a copy of my receipt.\nThe issue with the wallet is that the credit card pockets are sewn shut and I am unable to store my cards inside securely. The picture of the item on your website clearly shows cards safely stored in the little pouches so I’m sure this is a manufacturing flaw. Besides, I ordered a brown wallet but to my surprise the delivered product is black!\nAs a solution, and because I really like the wallet, I am hoping that you will agree to send me another one for free. Otherwise, I would like a full refund and I will be contacting PayPal complaints if I do not hear back from you in regards to this within a week.\nThank you for giving the matter your attention and I hope to hear your reply soon.\nYours faithfully,\nAdam Water",

            "Dear Sir or Madam,\nI am writing this letter to let you know that I am not exactly very happy with the product of your company which I purchased from your eCommerce store about a week ago. I hope you will either replace it or refund the money.\nThe product, I am talking about, is a travel bag. I paid $270 for this product but unfortunately, this bag does not look like the one I saw on your website as far as its colour and design is concerned. In fact, the bag, I ordered online, was light yellow while the bag I have received is dark yellow. Besides, the fabric, which has been used inside the bag as an inner layer, looks to be of very poor quality. Finally, the design is not exactly the same and I wonder how could this happen!\nAnyway, I do not like to sound like a complaining person, trying to find faults in the bag I have purchased. So, I would highly appreciate it if you please replace this bag with a bag of better quality as well as with the colour and design that I had initially ordered for. But, if you do not have what I have been looking for, please make a full refund to me as soon as you can.\nThank you in advance.\nYours faithfully,\nKelly Megan\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\nRating 4.75 (10 Votes)\nIELTS Letter Writing\nGT Writing Task 1\nFormal Letter\nComplaints-letter\nPrev\nNext\nName\nPreview\nSend\nReset\nCancel\nRSS\nLê Thanh Tâm\n3 years 3 months\nYou have recently ordered an item through the Internet, but you are not happy with the product.\nWrite to the company. In your letter:\n- describe what you purchased\n- explain why you are not happy with the product\n- tell them what you would like them to do about it\nYou should write at least 150 words.\nSample Letter:\nDear Sir or Madam,\nI am writing this letter to express my dissatisfaction with the product of your company which I ordered from your online shop last week. I hope you will either replace it or refund the money.\nThe product I ordered online was a pair of high heels in size thirty-seven. I paid 100 dollars for this item. However, The shoes that I purchased online were white while the shoes I received were light yellow. Besides, The size of the shoes was too small for what I demanded.\nFurthermore, when I opened the parcel I was surprised at the poor package quality. Lead to the fact that, the item is damaged surface fabric. Finally, you promised that you would deliver within three days, but it took over seven days. As a result, I could not wear them on my sister's wedding day. I consider the service so disappointing.\nSince I quite like the design of these high heels, I would highly appreciate it if you please replace these shoes with a product of better quality. Please maintain the colour and size that I had initially ordered for. Otherwise, I would like a full refund as soon as is convenient.\nI am looking forwards to receiving your response.\nYours faithfully,\nHana Thanh\nReply\nQuote\nJahnavi Rawal\n3 years 3 months\nYou have recently ordered an item through the Internet, but you are not happy with the product.\nWrite an email to the company. In your email:\n- describe what you purchased\n- explain why you are not happy with the product\n- tell them what you would like them to do about it\nYou should write at least 150 words.\nSample Email:\nDear Sir or Madam,\nMy name is Rawal Rahul, and I am writing to express my dissatisfaction regarding the service that was offered to me by your organization.\nI have been using your services for the last 4 years and I always admire your customer service quality. However, this time I felt disappointed. I would like to share my experience in detail.\nLast Friday, I ordered a couple of video games from your online store for my brother for his birthday. After receiving the parcel, we were trying to play the games, but after trying hard, we got to know that all three of the disks were corrupted! Soon, I tried to call your customer service department, but I did not get the expected answer. They told me that before sending the product they always do a quality check. They also told me that the disks are not covered by the standard warranty.\nAs a result, I had to spend a disappointing time and not to mention it ruined my younger brother's birthday. Therefore, I would like to request you to kindly fix this problem as soon as possible.\nI am looking forward to your favourable actions.\nYours faithfully,\nRawal Rahul\nReply\nQuote\n×\nReport\nReport\nClose"
