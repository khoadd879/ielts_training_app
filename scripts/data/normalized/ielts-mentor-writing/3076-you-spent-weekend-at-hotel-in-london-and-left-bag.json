            "Dear Sir or Madam,\nI am writing to inform you that I may have left my duffel bag at your hotel before leaving the place. I am hoping that you would arrange to send the bag to my address.\nTo give you some information about me, my name is Howard Jackson, and I stayed at your hotel from 12th to 14th March. I stayed in room 325 on the second floor. Not sure how I forgot to pick up that bag before leaving for the airport, but by the time I realized that I did not have my duffel bag with me, I was very much on my way to Melbourne. I guess that I have left it just below the bed.\nAbout the bag that I have left, it is a white travel bag, with two blue straps around it, and it has only a single belt to hold and carry. It is not a big bag either, and it mostly contains some important personal stuff, like an expensive hair trimmer (given to me as a gift), a Samsung smartphone and some rare pictures of my nephews and nieces.\nSo, please mail that bag to me as soon as you find it.\nYours faithfully,\nHoward Jackson\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\nRating 4.88 (4 Votes)\nIELTS Letter Writing\nGT Writing Task 1\nFormal Letter\nPrev\nNext\nName\nPreview\nSend\nReset\nCancel\nRSS\nVictor\n7 years 8 months\nDear Sir or Madam,My name is Victor and I stayed at your hotel for four days, from 21/03/2018 to 25/03/2018, and checked out from your hotel at 11:00 AM on 25th March 2018.
