I can spare time from 4.30 pm onwards on weekdays and full-time on weekends.\nI have previously worked as a customer support officer in a call centre in Japan and as a sales executive in a superstore in London. I have attached my Curriculum Vitae with this letter for your kind consideration which further details my education and work experience.\nI look forward to hearing from you and getting the details process to register with your job agency. Thank you in advance.\nYours faithfully,\nHansen Lee",
