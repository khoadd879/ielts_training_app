Please notify its availability either on 24th or on 26th July. We are expecting 40 guests on the programme and need the menu for dinner and drinks. Some of our guests are coming from overseas so we will require some continental dishes. We also need a projector and electricity backup so that we can show some presentations to our overseas partners without any interruption. Kindly inform me of the breakdown costs of your service, venue, food and drinks in the return mail.\nPlease be noted that the event is profoundly important for us and any sort of flaws will detriment our company's image as well as yours so I hope you will be rigorous in providing your service.\nI am looking forward to hearing from you soon.\nYours faithfully,\nJohn Augustin\n[",

And, once we finish the party, we also want you to serve dinner for us. So please give me details of the venue, the menu you would arrange and other facilities that you can offer with the breakdown of the cost.\nIn addition to that, we would also require a high-resolution LCD projector and a Wi-Fi connection facility for our Laptops. Please inform me if you can arrange that for us. Besides, the perfect seating arrangement for all of our 100 staff members is also expected. Finally, we also require facilities for welcome drinks for guests.\nTherefore, based on these requirements, please provide a quote for all the prices which you will charge us for all the services we will use.\nYours faithfully,\nKatie Derham\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\nRating 5.00 (4 Votes)\nIELTS Letter Writing\nGT Writing Task 1\nSemi-formal Letter\nInquiry Letter\nPrev\nNext\nName\nPreview\nSend\nReset\nCancel\nRSS\n×\nReport\nReport\nClose"
