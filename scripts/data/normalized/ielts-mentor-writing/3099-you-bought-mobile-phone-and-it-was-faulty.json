            "Dear Sir or Madam,\nI am Wesley Phillip from Boston, USA, writing to inform you that, three days ago, I ordered a Samsung Galaxy A23 smartphone from your online store. I was excited when it arrived earlier today but very disappointed to find that the product was faulty and not the one I ordered! I am hoping you will replace it immediately.\nIn relation to the specifics of the order, I purchased this mobile phone through your website called Phone and Gadgets on July 17th using my PayPal account. The order number is 56900145, and I am attaching a copy of my receipt.\nThe issue with the phone is that the front camera does not work, and the internal memory is 64 GB, though I ordered a 128 GB phone. The description of the item on your website clearly shows it is a 128 GB phone, so I am sure this is a mistake made on your side while dispatching the product.\nAs a solution, and because I really like this specific model, I am hoping that you will agree to replace the phone according to the specification of the order. Otherwise, I would like a full refund and I will be contacting PayPal complaints if I do not hear back from you in regards to this within a week.\nThank you for giving the matter your attention and I hope to hear your reply soon.\nYours faithfully,\nWesley Phillip",
            "Dear Sir or Madam,\nI have recently purchased an iPhone (14 Plus, 4 GB/128 GB, black colour) from your online store, and to my utmost disappointment, when I unwrapped the packet, I found a faulty phone instead of a fresh and new one. I am hoping that you would replace it soon.\nI am Sarah Liam, a resident of Edmonton, Alberta, and I placed the order on 14th January 2023 from your e-commerce website. The order number is STR-4546514, and I paid with my VISA credit card. The next day when the parcel reached my home, I stripped the package only to notice that I was delivered a defective phone.\nFirst of all, the phone screen has some visible scratch marks, which is unlikely. The internal memory of the phone is 64 GB, though I ordered a 128 GB phone! This must have been an oversight from your delivery department. The phone hung after a few minutes only to deepen my disappointment.\nI have not paid for a faulty or refurbished phone and would like to hear why I was delivered a flawed product in the first place. Moreover, I expect someone from your company replaces my phone at my location so that I do not have to travel to your office.\nI am attaching a copy of my order confirmation email and receipt with this letter for your kind consideration.\nYours faithfully,\nSarah Liam\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\nRating 4.00 (12 Votes)\nIELTS Letter Writing\nGT Writing Task 1\nFormal Letter\nPrev\nNext\nName\nPreview\nSend\nReset\nCancel\nRSS\n×\nReport\nReport\nClose"
