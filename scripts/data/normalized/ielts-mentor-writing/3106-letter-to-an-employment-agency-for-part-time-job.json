            "Dear Sir or Madam,\nI have heard about your employment agency from my friend who recently got a two-year work placement at a Japanese company, courtesy of your wonderful efforts. Not to mention, of course, after hearing the success story from my friend, I have also decided to reach you and request you find a suitable part-time job for me.\nTo introduce myself a little, I am a Greek national and currently studying at a university as a final-year student, majoring in Accounting Information Systems, here in Montreal. My current GPA is 3.5 if it really matters.\nAs for what sort of job I want, an office job, preferably as an Accounting Clerk or Data Entry Operator would be a very ideal one. I should also have no problem working as a part-time Office Administrator, provided that the schedules, I am offered, do not conflict with my class schedules.\nNow regarding my experience and skills, I have a very good typing speed, and I am very much computer literate. Besides, I am also good at multitasking, and I can speak little French, other than having a very good fluency in the English language.\nI hope you would help me find a part-time job as soon as possible. Thank you in advance.\nYours faithfully,\nZoe Laskari\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\nRating 4.04 (12 Votes)\nIELTS Letter Writing\nGT Writing Task 1\nFormal Letter\nPrev\nNext\nName\nPreview\nSend\nReset\nCancel\nRSS\n×\nReport\nReport\nClose"
