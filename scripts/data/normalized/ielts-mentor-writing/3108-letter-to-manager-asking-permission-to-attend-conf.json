            "Dear Mrs Patricia,\nI am Anna Ferguson, a senior officer in your New Jersey office. I am writing in regard to a business conference which would take place in New York from 22nd to 26th September on 'Green Entrepreneurship & Management Skills'. I am hoping that you would permit me to attend this conference and give me a chance to better serve my position with the knowledge learned.\nThis conference is being hosted by IPOC, a renowned business research organisation, and it would be presided over by some industry experts. I learned about it from an advertisement published on 12 August in the Daily Business People newspaper.\nThe conference would cover different aspects of green business and entrepreneurship, steps to engage in forward-thinking policies for environmental concerns, policies affecting human rights and implementing changes and evaluating progress. As we are planning to comply with the green business policies, I can contribute to that from the theories and ideas learned from the discussion.\nI would hereby request you to kindly authorize me to attend this convention and oblige thereby.\nI hope to receive your permission soon.\nYours sincerely,\nAnna Ferguson\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\nRating 4.37 (15 Votes)\nIELTS Letter Writing\nGT Writing Task 1\nSemi-formal Letter\nPrev\nNext\nName\nPreview\nSend\nReset\nCancel\nRSS\nZafran\n5 years 5 months\nI'm interested.
