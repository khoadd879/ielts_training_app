            "Dear Sir or Madam,\nI am writing to express my appreciation for the meal and service that your restaurant provided us last Sunday on the occasion of my 21st birthday.\nYour restaurant is located near my office, and I took a few friends and colleagues to celebrate my birthday based on a recommendation from one of my colleagues. We had lunch at your establishment and it was fabulous. The experience made my birthday even special, and I am quite thankful for an auspicious service and delicious menu.\nWe were greeted properly just when we entered the restaurant, and surprisingly, the manager himself came down to us and arranged an excellent sitting place for us from where we enjoyed a great view. A waiter came to tantalize our taste buds explaining the details of the menu. We had the \"Thai soup\" to start with. It was served just perfectly, and it smelled great. Then we opted for mackerel and fried rice which were well flavoured and had a decent portion of 4 fillets with each serving. For the main course, we had the lamb cutlets which melted in our mouths tenderly and came with a delightfully spiced harissa sauce. I must say that your food made our day!\nWe absolutely took away something truly special from this visit. Thank you once again for a fantastic experience at your establishment. We can not wait until our next visit!\nYours faithfully,\nTom Chatfield\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\nRating 2.69 (26 Votes)\nIELTS Letter Writing\nGT Writing Task 1\nFormal Letter\nPrev\nNext\nName\nPreview\nSend\nReset\nCancel\nRSS\nNaomi Eboigbe\n1 year 3 months\nNice sample; I would like to download it.\nReply\nQuote\n×\nReport\nReport\nClose"
