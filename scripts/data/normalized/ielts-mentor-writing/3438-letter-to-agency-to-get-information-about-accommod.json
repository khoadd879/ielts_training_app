            "Dear Sir or Madam,\nI am writing to get some details about accommodation in Sydney that your agency can arrange for me.\nI have been accepted at Macquarie University in a research-based Master's degree programme, and I will start my classes next June. I will stay there for one year and my wife will accompany me during my stay there. Therefore, I need a separate accommodation, not the one the university has offered me in its residence hall.\nI am looking for a studio apartment that will not cost me more than $1500 per month and is located within the walking distance of the university. It would be ideal if the apartment comes with a fully equipped kitchen and fully furnished rooms with windows that allow natural light and fresh air. It would be a bonus if we can access shopping malls, markets, a park and other public amenities without travelling a long distance.\nI will fly to Sydney on 29th May and would highly appreciate it if you can send me details of several accommodations - the kind I am looking for, within the budget.\nI am hoping to hear from you soon regarding this.\nYours faithfully,\nAvinash Kumar\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\nRating 4.50 (9 Votes)\nIELTS Letter Writing\nGT Writing Task 1\nFormal Letter\nRequesting-information-letter\nPrev\nNext\nName\nPreview\nSend\nReset\nCancel\nRSS\nJatinder\n5 years 8 months\nDear Sir or Madam,\nI am Anita Kapoor, writing this letter to request you to find suitable accommodation for my family and me.\nWe have recently got a Canadian Holiday Work Visa. So we are coming over there a few months later. I have been selected for a software developer position in the Dell International, which is located in Toronto, Downtown. It is a one-year contractual job, and for my children and me, it's an excellent opportunity to learn about foreign culture.\nSo, I am looking for a two-bedroom apartment, which would cost not more than $1600 per month, and should be close to the subway station so that I can easily commute to and from my office. Additionally, there should be a school within walking distance from the apartment. Thus, I will be able to quickly drop and pick my children. Besides, the kitchen should be equipped with necessary facilities such as a refrigerator, microwave oven, stove and window attached to it.\nWe will be arriving in Canada on the 23rd of March 2022. So, I want to finalize everything before that speculated date. I am hoping that your agency will arrange a suitable apartment for us to live in during our stay.\nI am hoping to hear from you soon.\nYours faithfully,\nAnita Kapoor\nReply\nQuote\nSachin\n4 years 8 months\nYou have written a letter in a very easy way, and from point to point.\nReply\nQuote\n×\nReport\nReport\nClose"
