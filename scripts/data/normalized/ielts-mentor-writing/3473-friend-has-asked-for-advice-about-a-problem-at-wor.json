            "Dear Sam,\nHope you're doing great. I've got your recent letter and learned about the problem, which you seem to be currently facing at your work. Of course, I feel a bit frustrated about this issue of yours, but please understand that this kind of problem is not very unique.\nIn fact, I also had to deal with this type of problem about a couple of years ago when I was also asked to visit our manufacturing plant to train some junior staff members in a different city almost every other day, even though it was never a part of my job description. But, I kept doing it as long as I could, but then went on to prove to my upper management how the quality of my regular tasks was being affected rather negatively as I was getting a bit too tired of the long travel to finish my regular tasks on time.\nLuckily, the upper management understood my problem as I spoke to them very candidly. I suggest, you also talk to your superior about your problem with some facts, and I'm sure that they will listen.\nWishing you all the best. Take care.\nWarm wishes,\nGregory\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\nRating 4.36 (7 Votes)\nIELTS Letter Writing\nGT Writing Task 1\nInformal Letter\nPrev\nNext\nName\nPreview\nSend\nReset\nCancel\nRSS\n×\nReport\nReport\nClose"
