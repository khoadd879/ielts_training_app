            "Dear Mr Clive,\nI hope you and your family are doing well. My name is Louis Fabian, and I rented one of your apartments on Jenkins Avenue and lived there for a year before leaving the place last month. Anyway, the reason, for which, I am writing this letter to you is that even though I left the apartment in good condition, I did not receive my money, as per the leasing agreement, which was paid to you as a refundable deposit when I rented your apartment.\nOf course, not receiving the refundable deposit from you is frustrating enough for me, but even more frustrating is the fact that you did not care to specify any possible reasons as to why I should not get my deposit back.\nAnd since you failed to give me any reason whatsoever as to why I should not get my deposit back, it is only fair that you refund my money to me without any delay. But, if you are not willing to cooperate with me on this, I am afraid that I will have to take legal action against you to decide the matter in court.\nYours sincerely,\nLouis Fabian\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\nRating 3.82 (11 Votes)\nIELTS Letter Writing\nGT Writing Task 1\nSemi-formal Letter\nPrev\nNext\nName\nPreview\nSend\nReset\nCancel\nRSS\n×\nReport\nReport\nClose"
