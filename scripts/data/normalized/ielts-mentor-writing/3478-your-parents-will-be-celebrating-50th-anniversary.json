            "Dear Julia,\nHope you are doing excellent. I am writing this letter because I need some advice from a professional event planner like you. And I need it because my parents are going to celebrate their 50th wedding anniversary soon, and I just don’t have a clue about how to make this occasion a memorable one.\nBy the way, this 50th anniversary is going to be a special occasion for my parents because they've been through a lot of ups and downs in their 50 years of married life, and yet their love for each other seems to be as fresh and deep as the day when they got married. Of course, I've plans to buy them some perfect gifts and create a slideshow full of their memories, but I'm not too sure if that’s what will go with the appeal of such a grand occasion. Besides, I'm still undecided where to organise the event, how to decorate the venue and whom to invite.\nSo, please meet me the day after tomorrow at around 5:30 pm at your office so that I can discuss my plans with you while also borrowing some of your expert ideas to turn this grand event into a successful one.\nBest wishes,\nLinda\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\nRating 4.57 (7 Votes)\nIELTS Letter Writing\nGT Writing Task 1\nInformal Letter\nPersonal Letter\nletter to a friend\nPrev\nNext\nName\nPreview\nSend\nReset\nCancel\nRSS\nUmar\n5 years 3 months\nIt's exceeding 150 words, it's 208 words.\nReply\nQuote\n×\nReport\nReport\nClose"
