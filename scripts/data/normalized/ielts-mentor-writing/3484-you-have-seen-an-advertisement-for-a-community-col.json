            "Dear Sir or Madam,\nI am writing this letter to express my interest to work as an English teacher at your community college on the night shift. I am applying for this post in response to an advertisement which was published in a local daily newspaper a couple of days ago.\nI have been looking for this kind of opportunity for a long time to teach English, but, because of my day-time job, I have not been able to do it so far. Now that you are offering such an opportunity, I want to grab it with my two hands, not only to teach the arts of English communication to the students but also to contribute to a good cause.\nIn support of my eligibility to teach English at your college, I have completed a Bachelor degree in Education, and I have a short certification course on \"Grammar, Vocabulary and Accent Training\". Besides, I have also done some home tutoring in English teaching for young children before.\nI am confident that I will be able to do a fine job of teaching English at your college, only if you give me a chance.\nYours faithfully,\nJamie Bower\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\nRating 4.56 (9 Votes)\nIELTS Letter Writing\nGT Writing Task 1\nFormal Letter\nPrev\nNext\nName\nPreview\nSend\nReset\nCancel\nRSS\n×\nReport\nReport\nClose"
