            "Dear Mr Watson,\nI hope that you are doing well. I have been a resident of your Sky Village Apartment Complex for almost 5 years, and I must say that I have enjoyed living here all these years without any major problems. However, lately, I, like many other residents in your high-rising building, have been dealing with an issue which, I think, deserves some immediate attention from your part.\nThis issue, I am talking about, is related to the efficient use of our communal laundry room where people sometimes have to wait for a significant period of time to use the washers and dryers in order to do their laundry because there are not just enough laundry baskets available in the room. This problem becomes even more acute when people do not bother to empty the washing machines and dryers on time when their laundry is done.\nSo, based on these problems, I would really appreciate it if you purchase at least 10 extra laundry buckets so that the laundry users, waiting for their turns to do their laundry, can empty the laundry machines and keep their contents into those baskets. This will improve the situation to a great extent and reduce our waiting time significantly.\nI hope to hear from you soon regarding this.\nYours sincerely,\nLance Donovan\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\nRating 4.90 (5 Votes)\nIELTS Letter Writing\nGT Writing Task 1\nSemi-formal Letter\nPrev\nNext\nName\nPreview\nSend\nReset\nCancel\nRSS\n×\nReport\nReport\nClose"
