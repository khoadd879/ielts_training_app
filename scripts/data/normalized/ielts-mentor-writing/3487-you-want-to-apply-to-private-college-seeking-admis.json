            "Dear Sir or Madam,\nI am Jonathon Mitch, and I am writing this letter in order to receive some necessary information regarding scholarships and tuition subsidies - aimed at helping undergraduate students financially, which is offered by your college. I have recently graduated from high school with a GPA of 3.85 on a scale of 4, and I want to apply to get admitted to your college to continue my study for a Bachelor degree.\nI need this information because my family is currently suffering from some economic hardship. They will not be able to pay me for my educational expenses since my father, the only income-earning member of my family, has got laid off from his job very recently. Besides, as a low middle-income family, we do not have any kind of savings which would help me meet all of my educational expenses at a prestigious private college like yours without some sort of financial help. So I am hoping for your kind consideration and help.\nI would like to thank you for your time and consideration in advance.\nYours faithfully,\nJonathon Mitch\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\nRating 4.18 (11 Votes)\nIELTS Letter Writing\nGT Writing Task 1\nFormal Letter\nPrev\nNext\nName\nPreview\nSend\nReset\nCancel\nRSS\n×\nReport\nReport\nClose"
