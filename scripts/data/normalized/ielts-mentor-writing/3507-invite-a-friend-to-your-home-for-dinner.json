            "Dear Cane,\nI'm so glad to know that you're currently visiting my city for some work. I also hope that you're managing to do your work without any trouble. I'm so looking forward to meeting you.\nI had always wanted to invite you to visit me and my city after meeting you about 6 months ago. But because of my busy work schedule, I couldn’t do so yet. But, now that you are already in my city, I don’t really want to let pass this opportunity to invite you. In fact, I want to invite you to my home in order to enjoy some dinner with me next Saturday which would be the 20th of September.\nAs for my location, I live only about a 15-minute drive away from your hotel. All you need to do is head towards the west on Highway 9 and drive about 10 minutes to reach Edmond Street. After reaching Edmond Street, drive about 5 minutes on Fuller road towards the north until you reach the midway mall. My home is right behind the mall. But, don’t hesitate to call me if you've any trouble finding my location.\nHope to see you soon then!\nWarm wishes,\nPeter\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\nRating 4.22 (9 Votes)\nIELTS Letter Writing\nInformal Letter\nPersonal Letter\nPrev\nNext\nName\nPreview\nSend\nReset\nCancel\nRSS\n×\nReport\nReport\nClose"
