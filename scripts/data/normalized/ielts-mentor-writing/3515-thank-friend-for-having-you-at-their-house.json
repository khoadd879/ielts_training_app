            "Dear Robert,\nHope all is well at your end. I'm also carrying on well with my life and works. Anyway, I just wanted to let you know how grateful and thankful I really am for allowing me to stay at your house for the whole week in order to help me attend the training course in the last month. After all, it would have been really difficult for me to find another suitable place on such short notice since I was informed about the training programme only just a few days before the start of the training.\nI'm also very much grateful for the kind and generous hospitality that were shown to me by your entire family. I especially enjoyed my afternoon snack time with your whole family after returning from my training. Besides, I also liked how you took me to do fishing at a nearby lake during the weekend while making a video of it. In fact, during that one week of stay at your place, I very much felt like a part of your great family, so no wonder that I miss all of you after leaving your city.\nPlease send my gratitude to everyone in your family.\nWarm wishes,\nThomas\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\nRating 4.75 (6 Votes)\nIELTS Letter Writing\nGT Writing Task 1\nInformal Letter\nPrev\nNext\nName\nPreview\nSend\nReset\nCancel\nRSS\nMd.
