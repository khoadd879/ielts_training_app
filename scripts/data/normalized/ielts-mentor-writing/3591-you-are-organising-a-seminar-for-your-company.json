            "Dear Mr Larry,\nI hope I have not caught you at a busy and critical time.  Anyway, the reason, for which, I am writing this letter to you is that I am going to organize a seminar on “how to maintain a strict quality assurance policy” after a week, and I would very much like you and your team members from “procurement department” to give a presentation.\nAfter all, we all in our company know how successful your department has been over the years in procuring the best quality raw materials for our company, and your inputs on how to maintain the best temperatures at our warehouses, where we stock our products, and how to pack them properly, especially during the rainy seasons, would certainly benefit our “production department” and company immensely.  In essence, your experience and thoughts in the seminar would go a long way to help us deliver the best quality products to our customers.\nBy the way, the seminar will be conducted from 3:00 pm to 5:00 pm on Tuesday, which is 11th of December, and we surely would appreciate it if you oblige us with your valuable presence there in that seminar.\nYours sincerely,\nChaminda Charles\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\nRating 4.19 (8 Votes)\nIELTS Letter Writing\nGT Writing Task 1\nPrev\nNext\nName\nPreview\nSend\nReset\nCancel\nRSS\n×\nReport\nReport\nClose"
