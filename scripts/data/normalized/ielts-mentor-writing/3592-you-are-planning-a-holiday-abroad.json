            "Dear Russel,\nNot sure exactly when I heard from you the last time, but it must have been at least a few years since we spoke to each other. You'd be glad to know that I've switched to a different job as a Senior Accounting Manager which actually allows me to roam around different places instead of doing something just by sitting at a desk.  Besides, I also run a small café now during the weekend, right across the market near the new stadium, which you saw being built last time you visited me.\nNow about the reason why I am exactly writing to you.  Actually, I will be visiting your town early next month to help my youngest uncle move with all of his stuff because he got a new job there. Oh, I hope that you can still remember my youngest uncle with some “limited mobility” issue.\nHowever, when I visit your town, I'd also like to enjoy that famous horse race which takes place every year.  Besides, I would also like for you to take me to the open street market while I'm there.  So, hope to see you soon!\nWarm wishes,\nDavid\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\nRating 4.07 (7 Votes)\nIELTS Letter Writing\nGT Writing Task 1\nInformal Letter\nPrev\nNext\nName\nPreview\nSend\nReset\nCancel\nRSS\n×\nReport\nReport\nClose"
