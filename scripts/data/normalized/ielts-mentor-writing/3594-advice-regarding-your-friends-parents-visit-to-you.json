            "Dear Jessica,\nI'm so glad to hear from you after a long time.  I'm also very happy that your parents are planning to visit the area where I live.  So, any idea as to exactly what time of the year your parents are planning to visit?  But, if I were them, I'd visit it during the spring because that’s when it becomes alive and more enjoyable due to the formation of some “bird colony”.\nThey can also visit the large shopping mall during the daytime while visiting the small restaurants near the river during the evening.  They can enjoy some affordable but fresh food, in addition to visiting a famous but old olive garden there.  But, if they are not into any of these things, I'd be more than happy to accompany them to some temples, the museum, and also perhaps meet some very generous local residents.\nBy the way, once they visit here, they can stay at one of the hotels on north Rupel Street since they are not only affordable but also close to the downtown.\nHope to meet them soon.  Talk to you again!\nBest wishes,\nEmma\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\nRating 3.67 (9 Votes)\nIELTS Letter Writing\nGT Writing Task 1\nPersonal Letter\nPrev\nNext\nName\nPreview\nSend\nReset\nCancel\nRSS\n×\nReport\nReport\nClose"
