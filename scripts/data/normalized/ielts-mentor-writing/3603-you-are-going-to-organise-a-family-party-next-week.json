            "Dear Carl,\nHope all is well at your end with you and your family. I know that you don’t really like to attend any kind of party, but I still took the liberty to invite you to one since it's going to involve mostly the family members of my extended family. After all, I'm well aware of the fact that you don’t really feel comfortable being around strangers.\nOh, in case you are wondering, my family has decided to organize this party in order to congratulate my youngest uncle who recently has received his license to practice medicine after struggling for almost two years! This party is going to be more like a casual party, it won’t include too many things except enjoying some freshly-made dinner, and light music, which were especially enjoyed by my uncle when he still was a student.\nThe party is going to be held on 23rd August, this month, and I'd very much like you to join it since this is going to allow you an opportunity to recuperate from the boredom of some tough engineering lessons and mid-term examinations.\nWarm regards,\nMario\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\nRating 3.42 (13 Votes)\nIELTS Letter Writing\nAcademic Writing Task 1\nInformal Letter\nPersonal Letter\nPrev\nNext\nName\nPreview\nSend\nReset\nCancel\nRSS\n×\nReport\nReport\nClose"
