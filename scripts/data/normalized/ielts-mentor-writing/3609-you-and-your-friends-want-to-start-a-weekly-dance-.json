            "Dear Sir or Madam,\nMy name is Mike Gregory and I am writing this letter to enquire about the possibility of renting your hall for the purpose of holding some meetings for our dance club.\nWe will hold these meetings mainly to discuss a dance project that we want to successfully complete before the arrival of our national youth day so that the young artists, taking part in this dance project, can learn about their individual roles and responsibilities in the project. Again, please do not think that we want to rent your hall to actually practice dancing, rather we want it only to discuss how best we can organize and complete our upcoming dance project. By the way, we would like to use it only during the weekends from 5:00 pm to 9:00 pm for about 6 continuous weeks, and the meetings will be attended by about 15 to 20 people, each time.\nSo, based on the information above, I was just wondering if you could rent us the hall, and should you choose to do so, please specify the terms and conditions upon which we both can agree.\nYours faithfully,\nMike Gregory\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\nRating 4.21 (12 Votes)\nIELTS Letter Writing\nGT Writing Task 1\nFormal Letter\nPrev\nNext\nName\nPreview\nSend\nReset\nCancel\nRSS\n×\nReport\nReport\nClose"
