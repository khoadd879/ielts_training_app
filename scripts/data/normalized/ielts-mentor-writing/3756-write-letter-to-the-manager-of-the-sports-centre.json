            "Dear Sir or Madam,\nIn recent weeks, we have found some issues with your otherwise well-managed sports centre, and I just thought that it was the time to bring those problems to your attention to ensure the reputation of your famous sports centre and the comfort of its users.\nNow, let me explain the issues one by one. The first issue is that some of the doors of the changing rooms do not lock properly - probably because the lock systems have worn out or become old due to excessive use. Another problem is that sometimes, a foul smell hits us as soon as we enter those rooms either because they are not cleaned properly or do not get properly “deodorized”.\nOf course, I have already complained to the supervisor, in charge of the maintenance of your sports centre, a couple of times, but it looks like the issues have not exactly been addressed or solved. The last time I complained to him was two months ago, and despite his promise to fix the issues, nothing significant has been done.\nTherefore, I would appreciate it if you take the necessary steps to solve the problems, mentioned above, at your earliest convenience so that we all can get back to enjoying our time at your establishment, again, like we always did in the past.\nYours faithfully,\nMiranda Blake\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\nRating 3.46 (13 Votes)\nIELTS Letter Writing\nGT Writing Task 1\nFormal Letter\nComplaints-letter\nLetter Writing Sample\nPrev\nNext\nName\nPreview\nSend\nReset\nCancel\nRSS\n×\nReport\nReport\nClose"
