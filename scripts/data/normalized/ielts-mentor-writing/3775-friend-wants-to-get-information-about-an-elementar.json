            "Dear Bob,\nI understand how challenging it can become to choose a good elementary school for our children these days. So, here, as you requested, I'll try to provide some information on the elementary school, attended by my younger cousin, but please verify all the information before making a final decision.\nThe school, attended by my cousin, has a good reputation for grooming the little ones by providing them with a “semi-structured” learning environment where they can learn and say anything they wish. The school also has several great “after school” programmes, through which the children don’t only have fun, but also learn many important and practical things. But, the best part is, they don’t have any homework – something that your child is certainly going to enjoy! In other words, they learn everything at their school! And all these come at a rather reasonable price, in comparison with the other schools.\nSo, I think that you should get your child admitted there because he is not only going to enjoy learning there, but also he is going to do so at his own pace without any burden of extra study work at home.\nWarm wishes,\nJennifer\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\nRating 3.83 (12 Votes)\nGT Writing Task 1\nInformal Letter\nPersonal Letter\nInformative-letter\nLetter Writing Sample\nPrev\nNext\nName\nPreview\nSend\nReset\nCancel\nRSS\n×\nReport\nReport\nClose"
