            "Dear Sir or Madam,\nI am a resident of Woodley in Berkshire, and I have decided to write this letter after reading a recent news article about the plan to build a shopping centre in our residential area. Needless to say, we do not really like this idea, and I hope that you would take the necessary initiatives to halt this project which would otherwise disrupt the peaceful lives of the residents.\nOur residential area is already over-populated, with not enough streets and parking spaces. Of course, the shopping centre will have its own parking spaces, but sometimes, those parking spaces just might not be enough to accommodate all the cars. And if that is the case, the mall visitors most likely would park their cars in our streets and parking spaces, making our streets even more crowded. The commotions, businesses and people would make our peaceful residential area worse to live in.\nAnother problem is that our residential area has a sizable, college and university-going, young population who, most likely, would start wasting their time in the shopping centre in the name of socializing and having fun, instead of focusing on their studies.\nThese are just some of the possible negative effects, but they should be good enough to convince you to relocate this shopping centre to a commercial area, away from any residential areas.\nThank you in advance.\nYours faithfully,\nKeith Marshall\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\nRating 4.05 (21 Votes)\nIELTS Letter Writing\nGT Writing Task 1\nFormal Letter\nLetter Writing Sample\nPrev\nNext\nName\nPreview\nSend\nReset\nCancel\nRSS\n×\nReport\nReport\nClose"
