            "Dear Ben,\nI hope you’re doing great! The other day you were talking about an excellent restaurant you visited, and I was wondering if it might be a good place for my birthday party next week.\nI’m planning a small gathering with close friends, and I want to celebrate in a place with great food and a nice atmosphere.  Could you please let me know the name of the restaurant and how to get there? Since we’re in London, I’d love to know if it’s easily accessible by public transport. I'd also be interested in knowing if car parking is available nearby as some of my friends would love to drive their cars. Also please give me their Facebook or Google Business Page addresses so that I can contact them.\nPlease do come to the party. I’d also love to hear more about the type of cuisine they serve. Do they have any standout dishes you’d recommend? If you have any personal favourites from the menu, I’d love to know so I can check them out in advance.\nLooking forward to your reply!\nWarm wishes,\nNathan\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\nRating 5.00 (5 Votes)\nGT Writing Task 1\nInformal Letter\nRequesting-information-letter\nletter to a friend\nLetter Writing Sample\nPrev\nNext\nName\nPreview\nSend\nReset\nCancel\nRSS\n×\nReport\nReport\nClose"
