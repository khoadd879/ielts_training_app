            "Dear Farah,\nI hope you’re doing great! The other day, I remember you mentioned that you’re looking for a music teacher for your child. Since I was busy preparing food, I did not talk to you in detail about it. You'd be glad to know that I have the perfect recommendation for you.\nMy friend Anup from school is an experienced music teacher who has been teaching children for over 7 years. I can assure you that he is highly skilled in guitar and violin and also has a great way of making lessons both educational and fun. I am quite positive that he would be a great music teacher for your child. Anil holds a degree in education and a diploma in music and has worked with students of all ages, helping them develop strong musical skills and a love for music.\nIf you’d like to get in touch, you can reach Anil at +12554654978 or anil124.music(at).gmail.com. I’m sure he would be happy to discuss lessons and find a suitable schedule for your child.\nLet me know if you need any further details!\nWarm wishes,\nMithila\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\nRating 5.00 (4 Votes)\nIELTS Letter Writing\nGT Writing Task 1\nInformal Letter\nemail writing\nemail to friend\nLetter Writing Sample\nPrev\nNext\nName\nPreview\nSend\nReset\nCancel\nRSS\n×\nReport\nReport\nClose"
