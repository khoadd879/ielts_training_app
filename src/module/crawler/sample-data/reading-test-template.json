The average adult requires 7-9 hours of sleep per night for optimal health and cognitive function.\n\nThe sleep cycle consists of several stages, including REM (Rapid Eye Movement) and non-REM sleep. During REM sleep, the brain processes memories and emotions. Non-REM sleep is divided into three stages: N1 (light sleep), N2 (intermediate sleep), and N3 (deep sleep).\n\nResearchers have identified several key factors affecting sleep quality: room temperature, light exposure, noise levels, and pre-sleep activities. The optimal bedroom temperature for sleeping is between 15-19°C.\n\nSleep deprivation can lead to numerous health problems, including weakened immune function, increased risk of heart disease, weight gain, and impaired cognitive abilities. Chronic sleep loss has been linked to depression and anxiety disorders."
